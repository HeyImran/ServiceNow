javascript: 'manager=' + current.variables.requested_by



This is used to populate the groups that are owned by logged in User in the Catalog Item in a variable.

We need to create a variable with Reference type and table should be groups table.

Under the advanced tab, we can use this simple to load only groups for which the user is the group manager.
